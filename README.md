Description
-----------
Provide your email address to your readers, but hide it from spammers.

Installation
-----------
Install in just two simple steps!

1. Copy/paste code snippet into your WordPress theme's "functions.php" file.
2. Wrap your email address in the [email] shortcode.

Example: [email]john.doe@mysite.com[/email]

*NOTE: Every theme has a functions file stored in the theme's subdirectory, wp-content/themes. Most themes commonly name the functions file “functions.php”. But your theme may name your functions file something slightly different. For example, in Thesis 1.x it’s named “custom_functions.php” and in Thesis 2.x it’s named “custom.php”. Regardless of the name variation, both refer to your functions file.*
